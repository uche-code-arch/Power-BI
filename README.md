# FP ANALYSIS CHALLENGE
I worked on the FP analysis data using Power Bi as my analytical tool. 
I started by extracting the data into the Power Bi environment and running some cleaning on the data.
I used the power Bi query environment to run some analytical cleaning which involved checking for missing values,mis-labels,duplicates, e.t.c

Further more i did some Dax expressions on the data in calculating for some relevant measures that is required for better insights in the data.

I did some modelling in the given data where relationships that existed within the data was shown.

Then using charts the data was further visualized to explain better the insights gotten from the data.

# DRUG ABUSE AND CRIMINAL CRIMES ASSOCIATED WITH IT
This project is aimed at showcasing the relationship between drug abusers and the various crimes they commit with the response gotten from the police
and how much hospital care they get.
The Power Query environment was used to conduct some preproccessing analysis to include cleaning the dataset, checking for duplicates and mis-labes and making sure 
that there is consistency in formatting and generating meaningful insights from the data
